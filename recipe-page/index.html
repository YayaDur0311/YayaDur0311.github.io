            Creamy, bold, and deeply spiced, karak tea is the Middle Eastern 
        cousin of chai, known for its rich flavors and comforting warmth. 
        Infused with cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger, it’s simmered slowly to 
        create a velvety, fragrant cup. Perfect for chilly mornings or whenever 
        you need a little extra warmth, this tea never disappoints.

        <p>Karak tea is the kind of drink that wraps you up in warmth and 
            comfort with every sip. Super popular throughout the Middle East,
             it’s similar to chai but has its own distinctive flavor 
             profile that’s bold, creamy, and spiced just right. What makes 
             karak tea stand out is the deep richness of the evaporated milk 
            and the aromatic blend of spices like cardamom, cinnamon,
         and ginger. It’s perfect for when you’re craving something indulgent
          yet simple to make, whether you’re treating yourself or are having 
          company over. This recipe is all about layering those spices
           and flavors, and the best part is that you can adjust it to 
           suit your taste.

                <li>6 to 8 cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ginger cube (or a small piece of fresh ginger)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup light brown sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>4 black/red tea bags</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot, combine the water, evaporated milk, 
            cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and ginger. Bring the mixture to a 
            gentle boil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and let it 
            simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes. This allows the spices to infuse 
            the milk and water with their rich, warm flavors.</li>
            <li>Place the tea bags into the pot and let them steep for 3 to 
            5 minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea. 
            Stir occasionally to help the tea blend with the spiced milk. 
            You’ll know it’s ready when the color turns a deep, caramel brown. 
            Stir in the brown sugar until it dissolves completely.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla extract and let it simmer for another minute 
                to enhance the flavor.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat and carefully strain the tea 
                    into cups to remove the spices and tea bags.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
