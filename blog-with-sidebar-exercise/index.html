                    Robert F. Toby Fox is an American video game developer 
                    and composer. Best known for creating role-playing video 
                    games like Undertale & DeltaRune, which garnered acclaim 
                    and has received nominations for a British Academy Game 
                    Award, three Game Awards and D.I.C.E. Awards. 
                    <i>“You kill a lot of random monsters, 
                        (sometimes even humans) in every RPG and the 
                        consequences for this are never addressed."</i>

                    <i>“What if they were?”</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>This question sparked the idea for the indie 
                        game Undertale, an RPG made by Toby Fox, who 
                        did all the writing, programming, music and 
                        some of the art for the game. The rest of the 
                        artwork is done by one of his friends Temmie Chang 
                        and other few artists that are credited in the 
                        first Kickstarter campaign for Undertale! 
                        Earthbound on the Super Nintendo and other games 
                        back in Tobys childhood had a lasting 
                        impression on him.

                <p>
                    <i>“I was so young that it helped me learn to read, 
                    and also transformed my brain forever.”</i>
                    Besides gaming, in highschool he started 
                    playing the piano and trumpet, which in turn 
                    sparked his love for composing music. Fast forward
                     to his time in college, where Toby started
                      putting together the building blocks for his 
                      first real video games project. He initially didn’t 
                      start with a concrete idea for either gameplay 
                      or story. The first piece of inspiration actually 
                      came from Wikipedia.
                    </p>
                      <h3><a id="Concept">Concept</a></h3>
                      <p>
                        <i>"I wanted to create a system that 
                        satisfied my urge</a> 
                        for talking to monsters."</i>
                       Toby felt that it was important to make every 
                       monster feel like an individual. 
                       He said that: “All monsters in RPGs like Final 
                       Fantasy are the same, besides the design.
                       Toby used GameMaker 8 to create a demo for Undertale. 
                       As for Undertale’s core concept, 
                       he wanted to make an RPG that is different from 
                       all the games he grew up with. Collabarating with
                       others with the art while he set some rules for his
                       game, he sees the vision and going to it.

                <p>
                    <i>"I want to make an RPG game where you could befriend 
                    all of the bosses;  where not killing everything 
                    is actually a viable option. Since every RPG is 
                    about killing monsters."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of being trapped in an underground world was 
                    partially influenced by the game Brandish. 
                    As stated earlier, Toby already made a combat system 
                    of sorts before anything else, but it would take up a 
                    lot of time to polish and refine his unique take on 
                    turn based battles. He took inspiration from Mario & 
                    Luigi RPG Games like one called Superstar Saga. 
                    He made it at least simple and playable for those
                    who can enjoy his game.

                <i>Long ago, two races ruled over Earth: Humans and Monsters.
                One day, war broke out between two races. After a long battle,
                 the humans were victorious. They sealed the monsters 
                 underground with a magic spell.
                Many years later it became forgotten, there were stories 
                talking about the mountain.
                Legends say that those who climb the mountain never return.
                You, the player, fell into the underground, surprisingly 
                you survived the fall. 
                You choose the experience of how the monster's outcome 
                will be. You choose how will your story will end.</i>
