                    I know raccoons are not the first pet to come 
                    to mind but hear me out on what makes him so special.
                    Gary is a mischievous raccoon who is curious all the time!

                <h3>Ricky the Hamster</h3>
                <p>
                    Ricky is a sweet, friendly hamster with a big 
                    heart. He is quite active and enjoys exploring 
                    his surroundings, whether it is by digging in
                    his comfortable bedding or running on his wheel.
                    He is the ideal friend for anyone searching for
                    a cuddly companion because he loves to be 
                    cuddled and rubbed and will frequently curl up 
                    in your palm. How cute he is!
