        <h3>Instructions!</h3>
        <hr></hr>
        <br></br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set the oven to 425F (220C) and line a pie dish 
            with your pie dough.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Peel the pumpkin, then remove the stem and seeds,
                and quarter it. Slice each piece into thin slices, 
                about 1/4 inch thick. Repeat this process with the apples.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Put 2 tablespoons of the butter into a frying pan and set over 
                medium heat. Note that, depending on the amount of pumpkin you 
                fry, you may require more butter; you can also use lard or 
                vegetable oil. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Then mix the herbs into the beaten eggs and dip the pumpkin 
                slices into the egg, coating them lightly. Then place them into 
                the frying pan and fry for 10 minutes, or until the pumpkin is 
                quite soft. Depending on the size of your pumpkin, you may need 
                to do this in several batches. The pumpkin should not be more 
                than 3 layers thick in the pan.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                While the pumpkin fries, line the bottom of your pie crust with 
                the apples. Once the pumpkin is cooked, place it in a 
                bowl with 2 tablespoons of the butter, along with the 
                raisins, currants, sugar, and the sherry or sack.
                Mix everything together and pour over the apples, smoothing the 
                top.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake for 20 minutes at 425°F (220°C), then reduce heat to 375°F 
                (190°C) and bake 40-50 minutes longer, or until the top of the 
                pie is bubbling.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                With the extra dough, start placing the dough into a autumn
                shape cookie cutter. gently powder the dough and began adding
                maple flavor. Start baking it around (300F) degrees in the oven.
                Once down you must let it out of the oven and let those dough
                cool down.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove from the oven and set a on a wire rack. Scatter the 2 
                remaining tablespoons of butter on the top of the pie and allow 
                to melt in. Cool completely before slicing.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <br></br>

            <p>
                Usually made from a combination of fruits including; bananas, 
                raspberries, and strawberries, a pink punch smoothie is a 
                colorful and delicious beverage.
                Often, yogurt or coconut milk is added for a creamy texture, 
                while a touch of honey or agave nectar enhances the natural 
                sweetness.The end product is a beautifully pink frothy drink 
                that is as aesthetically pleasing as it is delicious!
